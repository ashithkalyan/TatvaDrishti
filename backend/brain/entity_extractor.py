KAVACH Brain — Crime-Domain Entity Extraction
=================================================
Rule-based extraction, tuned to the Karnataka crime domain rather than
attempting generic open-world NER (which needs training data we don't
have and can't honestly claim). Person names are resolved via a
closed-world scan against the actual database + the alias dictionary,
which is far more reliable than generic NER for this bounded task.

LANGUAGE COVERAGE — read this before assuming full Kannada fluency:
  Tier 1 (always on):    English + "Kanglish" (Kannada words typed in
                          Roman script) domain vocabulary — this is how
                          most Indian users actually type on phones.
  Tier 2 (optional):     A modest, clearly-labelled Kannada-script
                          glossary for the most common crime terms.
                          Extend this with a native speaker's input —
                          it is intentionally a plain dict, not logic.
  Tier 3 (optional, if
  Ollama is running):    Full free-form multilingual understanding via
                          a local open-weight LLM — see ollama_client.py.

    BUG FIX: this used to strip every space/hyphen from the WHOLE
    message before matching \\b\\d{18}\\b — meant to tolerate an officer
    formatting the number with internal spacing ("1001 0004 7202 1000

    which silently broke the \\b boundary check right where it mattered:
    a letter and a digit are both "word" characters, so there is no
    boundary between them once the space is gone. Any natural-language
    phrasing that put an FIR number at the end of a sentence with no

    True when person_name_candidates should actually be trusted as "the

    BUG FIX (KAVACH_vs_DRISHTI_Analysis.md §2.4): a bare capitalized word
    with no supporting context — "BNS", "France", and (confirmed via a
    live trace) even "Forecast" and "Urban" from unrelated queries —
    used to count as full proof that a message was "a real case

    entirely, so "What is BNS?" never got its own correct answer even
    though the glossary knows it, and (b) sent the message straight into
    a PersonIdentity search that predictably matched nobody, producing a
    misleading "No records found" for a question that was never about a
    person at all.

    A candidate is trusted when EITHER:
      - it's a multi-word phrase ("Naveen Poojary") — someone typing a
        full name is a strong signal, unlike one stray capitalized word
        that could be anything; or
      - the raw message contains an explicit name-search verb cue
        ("who is", "tell me about", "profile of", "history of"...).
    A single bare capitalized word with neither present is NOT trusted —
    that is exactly the "BNS" / "France" shape that caused this bug.

    Used consistently at all three points that previously disagreed
    with each other about how much to trust a weak candidate:
    brain.py's has_any_entity_early (gates the general_knowledge
    fallback), intent_engine.classify()'s fallback (decides whether to
    default to person_lookup), and brain.py's _needs_clarification
