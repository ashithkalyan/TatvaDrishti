"""
KAVACH Brain — Persistent Conversation Memory
=================================================
Gives KAVACH the same "remembers past conversations" behaviour Claude
has — built entirely in-house, with zero external embeddings API.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Every turn (both the officer's message and KAVACH's answer) is
   written to a local SQLite table, `conversation_memory`.
2. When a new message arrives, we don't just look at the current
   session — we search the officer's ENTIRE conversation history
   (including past sessions, days or weeks old) for turns that are
   textually related to the new message.
3. Relevance is scored with a small, self-built TF (term-frequency)
   cosine-similarity engine — the same family of technique real
   search/retrieval systems use, just without a 300-dimension neural
   embedding. It runs in pure Python, needs no model weights, and is
   fast enough at hackathon-database scale (hundreds to low thousands
   of turns) to run on every request.
4. If a strongly related past turn is found, it's surfaced to the
   officer ("This relates to a query from your session on ...") and
   passed to the SQL builder so follow-up-style queries ("only those
   involving minors") correctly inherit filters from way earlier in
   the conversation, or even a previous day's session.

This is real, working retrieval — not a hardcoded demo.

    turn has document_attached; a person_lookup turn has
    identity_reasoning_trace; neither is universal) and is exactly what
    the frontend already knows how to render — no separate persistence
    schema to keep in sync with the live response shape.

    `turn_index` is accepted for call-site compatibility (every caller
    still passes len(session_history) / +1, as before) but is NO LONGER

    # BUG FIX (KAVACH master-prompt review, "chat conversation order"):
    # turn_index used to be exactly the value the CALLER passed in —
    # computed from a `len(session_history)` snapshot read earlier in the
    # request. That's a classic time-of-check-to-time-of-use race: two
    # requests for the SAME session overlapping even slightly (a second
    # message sent while the first is still streaming its response, for
    # instance) can both read the same "current length" before either has
    # written anything, then both write COLLIDING turn_index values —
    # e.g. both user turns land at index 4, both assistant turns at
    # index 5. `ORDER BY turn_index` then groups every same-index row
    # together instead of interleaving them, which reproduces exactly
    # "several user messages bunched up, then several AI messages bunched
    # up" — a genuine data-ordering bug, not the chat UI's rendering code
    # (which was already rendering whatever order the backend returned,
    # correctly).
    #
    # Fixed by computing the real next index INSIDE this single INSERT,
    # from the table's own current max, in the same statement — SQLite's
    # single-writer transaction locking makes this safe even under
    # genuinely concurrent callers, unlike trusting a value computed in
