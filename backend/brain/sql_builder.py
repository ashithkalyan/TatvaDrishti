KAVACH Brain — SQL Query Builder
====================================
Deterministic, template-based SQL generation against vw_fir_flat and
vw_person_flat (defined in seed_data.py's create_schema) — querying
flattened views instead of raw joins keeps every template here short
and auditable, and means the same templates keep working even if the
underlying normalised schema gains more tables later.

Every query is a parameterised SELECT — never string-interpolated
values — and every template is a plain, readable function, not a
generated string, so anyone on the team can read exactly what each
intent produces.

A few intents (prediction, similarity, timeline, recommendation,
network path-finding) aren't SQL at all — they route to their own
brain modules. build() signals this with {"route": "..."} instead of
{"sql": ...}, and brain.py (the orchestrator) dispatches accordingly.

    # `resolved_names` is ALWAYS passed by brain.py's only caller (as
    # `alias_matches`, which is `[]` — not None — whenever name
    # candidates existed but none resolved to a real person). The old
    # `if resolved_names:` treated an EMPTY list the same as "resolution
    # was never attempted" and fell back to using the raw, unresolved
    # candidate text directly as a SQL name filter — meaning a word that
    # alias_resolver.py had already determined matches nobody (e.g.
    # "Urban", picked up as a stray capitalised word from "Bengaluru
    # Urban" and never resolved to any real person) still got used as a
    # `LIKE '%Urban%'` filter, silently turning an ordinary district
    # query into a person-scoped query that could only ever return zero
    # rows. Checking `is not None` instead means "resolution ran and
    # found nothing" correctly falls through to the ordinary
    # district/crime-type search below, while a genuine future caller
    # that skips resolution entirely (passing resolved_names=None) still
